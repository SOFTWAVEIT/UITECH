JavaScript Variable
-------------------
A variable is a container to store data. 

Variable Naming Rules:
----------------------
1) A variable name can have alpha-numeric characters(A-Z,a-z,0-9) , underscore(_) or dollar symbol ($)

2) A variable name should start with a letter or _ or $ symbol

3) No space is allowed between the characters of a variable name

4) A variable name should not be a reserved keyword of JS

5) Variable names are case sensitive

6) A JS variable is declared by using the script "var" or "let"

Examples:
 var firstName;
 let last_name;
 let _age;
 var _$_;

var firstName="Sunil";
console.log(firstName);


Java Script Data Types
----------------------
There are seven data types in JavaScript. 
They are :

1) String 
 "Softwave", 'softwave'

2) Number 
 10 (or) 10.24

3) Boolean  - Logical data type that can only be "true" or "false"

4) Undefined - Data type of a variable that does not have a value

5) null  / (object)

6) bigint
A BigInt is created by appending "n" to the end of an integer literal
BigInt is a special numeric type that provides support for integers of arbitrary length
let data = 12n;
let data = BigInt(12);

7) function
console.log(`${typeof(alert)})`


Java Script have dynamic typing feature- means that we do not have to define the data type of a variable. 

JS automatically finds the type of the variable , based on how it is set
let n = 25; - type of n is "number"

'typeof' operator is used to get the data type of a variable

typeof n
  OR
typeof(n)




Variable Mutation: - process of changing the value of a variable
age = 'thirty five';
job = 'Software Engineer';
alert(firstName + ' is a ' + age + ' year old ' + job + '. Is he married? ' + isMarried);



Difference between Undefined and null
-------------------------------------
"undefined" means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.  Eg: let data;

"null" is a value assigned to a variable, as a representation of no value.  Eg: let data=null

"undefined" and "null" are two different types: 
undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object type.

<script>
let test1 = null;
console.log(test1); //null
console.log(typeof test1); //object

let test2;
console.log(test2); //undefined
console.log(typeof test2);//undefined

console.log(undefined == null); //true
console.log(undefined === null); //false
</script>
