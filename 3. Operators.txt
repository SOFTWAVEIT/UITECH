JavaScript Operators
--------------------
Operators are used to perform some operations on data. 

Operators are broadly classified into 2 categories:

(a) Unary Operators - only one operand
	n++
(b) Binary Operators - two operands
	a+b

Different type of operators in Java Script are:

1) Arithmetic Operators

 +	-	*	/	%	

<script>
 let now, yearSunil;
 now = 2020;
 ageSunil = 40;
 yearSunil = now - ageSunil;
 console.log(yearSunil);
</script>

<script>
 let x, y;
 x = y = (3 + 5) * 4 - 6; 
 console.log(x, y);
</script>



2) Increment & Decrement Operators
	++	--



3) Relation/Comparison Operators

 ==	===	!=	!==	 >	>=	<	<=	

Note:  == will check only for the content, not for the data type where as === will check for the content and also for the type

null === undefined // false
null == undefined  // true

4)  Logical Operators - used for framing a compound condition

&&	Logical AND	
||	Logical OR	
	
((a>b) && (a>c))


5)  Assignment Operators

 =	+=	-=	*=	/=	 %=	

   a+=b	-------	a=a+b




6) Conditional or Ternary Operator

	?:   


7) String or Concatenation Operator
	+

8) Complement Operator	
   !
 !true	!false


9) Bitwise Operators
   &  Bitwise AND
   |  Bitwise OR
   ^  Bitwise XOR

10) Shift Operators
  <<   left shift
  >>   right shift


11) JavaScript Special Operators

(a) , -	comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.

(b) delete - deletes a property from the object.

(c) in	- checks if object has the given property

(d) instanceof  - checks if the object is an instance of given type

(e) new	- creates an instance (object)

(f) typeof - checks the data type of variable.



<script>
 let a=10, b=20, c=30;
 console.log(a,b,c); //10  20  30
</script>



<html>
<body>      
<script type="text/javascript">
 let b = "String";
       
 result = (typeof b  == "string") ? "B is String" : "B is Numeric";
 console.log("Result => "+result);

</script>       
</body>
